## Purpose
Record classification of variants against the ACMG criteria: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4544753/

## Project Goals & Objectives
* Record ACMG criteria that are met for a variant
* Calculate a classification based on ACMG rules

## Requirements
### Functional
* Open an ACMG classification form for a variant
* Display information about the test and variant
* Display each ACMG criterion alongside a checkbox
* Display and allow editing of the variant comment
* Display and allow editing of a comment for each ACMG criterion
* Calculate a classification based on ACMG rules
* Allow manual override of calculated classification
* Must be straightforward to identify variants that have been assessed against ACMG guidelines for audit purposes

### Technical (non-functional)
* Incorporated into existing Moka system:
  * Microsoft Access front end
  * MS SQL server backend
* Adhere to minimal viable product

### Usability
- Easily accessed from WES results page in Moka
